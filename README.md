This project is a Grocery Management System designed to streamline inventory management, sales, and product information. It allows users to add, view, edit, and buy products. The system stores product details such as ID, name, quantity, and price in a text file. Users can perform various operations like adding new products, updating existing ones, viewing available products, and buying products with billing functionality. The project aims to enhance efficiency in managing store inventory and facilitating smooth transactions for both customers and store owners. It's a user-friendly solution for small-scale retail businesses to automate their operations.
